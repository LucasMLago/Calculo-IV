# Calculo-IV
This repository contains a study based in sequences and series. The focus is in the implementation of a limit function based on SymPy, a libery which can be useful in terms of calculus.

## First Objective
Implement a function called *limit* to determine the limit of a sequence. Based on the 3 cases below:

  - If lim An = L ∈ R, the function must return the value to the nearest 2 decimal places.
  - If lim An = ∞, the function must return “infinity”.
  - If lim An does not exist, the function must return “does not exist”.

## Second Objective
Implement a function called *estimator* that supports as input a sequence *An* and returns a
approximation of the convergent series An with n starting at 1 and tending to infinity.
